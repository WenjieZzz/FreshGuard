After tasting the **sour milk** several times, I decide to develop a simple android app to eliminated the chance of food expiration in my house.

1. Ability to load the food's brand, name, category automatically after scanning the barcode
2. Expiration date T
  * Phase 1: Manually input it 
  * Phase 2: Scan the Eipration date and recognize it
3. Notification to finish the food on T-10, T-5, and show the related recipes at the same time
5. Notification to toss the food on T
